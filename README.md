a test for a job application

### Install:
* npm install
* gulp
* serve dist folder with a local server like http-server

####Instructions were
* Use any framework you want to complete test
* You are a good candidate if you don't need any framework to manipulate the dom
* You are a good candidate if you are not tied to any framework

...so I stuck to vanilla javascript
